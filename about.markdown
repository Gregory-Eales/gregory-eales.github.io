** still a work in progress **

Hey, welcome to my blog! I’m a Machine Learning Engineer currently @ Dynata working mainly on fraud detection and modelling user behavior. With recent advances in the field of AI taken up an interest in AI safety and interpretability and am looking to get into a more research oriented role in the future. This blog aims to document my thoughts and various projects I’ll be working on towards this goal.
